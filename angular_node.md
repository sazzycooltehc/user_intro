# 🚀 Angular + Node.js Dev Roadmap (8-Week Accelerated Edition)


> 🎯 Goal: Achieve Fullstack mastery (Angular, Node, Docker, K8s Basics) and job-ready soft skills in 8 weeks.
> ⏱️ Pace: Accelerated (30+ hours/week recommended).
> 👑 Final Project: WeatherPortal Pro (Authenticated, Containerized, CI/CD).

🗓️ Accelerated Weekly Progress Tracker
| Week | Technical Focus Area | Core Topics | Technical Soft Skill Focus | Project Output | Progress |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Solid Foundation | HTML/CSS Semantics, JS Deep Dive (Closures, Prototypes, Event Loop), TypeScript (Generics, Interfaces). | Effective Debugging: Mastering browser DevTools, clear error isolation, and using source maps. | Portfolio Page (TS Refactor) | [ ] |
| 1 | Angular Core | Components, Modules, Data Binding, CLI, Services & DI, Angular Router, RxJS Basics. | Code Review & Standards: Following ESLint/Prettier, writing highly readable, idiomatic Angular code. | Todo App (with Routing) | [ ] |
| 2 | Angular Data Mastery | RxJS Deep Dive (Operators: switchMap, map), HttpClient, Interceptors, Reactive Forms & Validation. | System Thinking: Diagramming data flow before coding, understanding component communication patterns. | Weather Dashboard (API calls) | [ ] |
| 3 | Angular Architecture | Lazy Loading, Performance, Standalone Components, Angular Signals, Basic NgRx or Service-based State Management. | Documentation & Knowledge Transfer: Writing clean README files and documenting complex state/RxJS logic. | Role-based Dashboard | [ ] |
| 4 | Backend API (Node) | Node.js, Express Setup, Middleware, REST API Design, Basic Database Integration (e.g., MongoDB/PostgreSQL). | API Contract Design: Defining clear, versioned API schemas and writing concise API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI). | CRUD REST API | [ ] |
| 5 | Integration & Security | JWT Authentication (Issuing/Verifying), Hashing, CORS, Environment Variables, Connect Angular to Node. | Security Mindset: Identifying and mitigating common web vulnerabilities (Injection, XSS) in code review. | Fullstack Authenticated App | [ ] |
| 6 | Containerization | Dockerfile (Multi-stage builds), Docker-Compose (App + DB setup), Container Networking, Local Testing. | IaC (Infrastructure as Code) Mindset: Treating configuration files (Docker, YAML) as valuable, version-controlled code. | Containerized Fullstack App | [ ] |
| 7 | Orchestration & CI | Kubernetes Basics (Pods, Deployments, Services, Minikube), GitHub Actions (CI Workflow: Build, Test, Push Image). | CI/CD Accountability: Taking full ownership of the pipeline; ensuring automation runs successfully before merging. | Deploy to Minikube + Set up CI | [ ] |
| 8 | Final Project & Testing | End-to-End Testing (Cypress/Jest), Final Cloud Deployment Strategy (AWS/Render/Vercel), System Optimization. | Technical Storytelling: Clearly articulating complex technical decisions and project trade-offs for interviews/stakeholders. | WeatherPortal Pro 🚀 | [ ] |
🧱 Milestones (Accelerated)
| Milestone | Description | Deadline | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | Angular Architect (Core, RxJS, Forms, Signals) mastery. | End of Week 3 | [ ] |
| M2 | Fullstack Engineer (Node.js, Security, Full Integration) complete. | End of Week 5 | [ ] |
| M3 | DevOps Ready (Docker, K8s, CI/CD Pipeline) established. | End of Week 7 | [ ] |
| M4 | Production-Grade Deployment and Final Project complete. | End of Week 8 | [ ] |
🧠 Optional Advanced Challenge (If time allows)
| Challenge | Focus |
|---|---|
| React/Vue Overview | Spend 1-2 days building a mini-project in another framework to understand cross-framework architecture. |
| Advanced K8s | Implement a basic Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) rule in your Kubernetes deployment. |

This accelerated roadmap ensures you touch every major aspect required for an Angular Dev role, while also deliberately practicing the soft skills that transform a good coder into a great engineering lead.
