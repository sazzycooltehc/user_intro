⚔️ Operation: Mid-Senior Engineer (6-Week Plan)

Objective: Transform from "Coder" to "Mid-Senior Engineer" capable of architectural defense, performance optimization, and business value articulation.

Tech Stack: Angular, Node.js, Spring Boot.

Core Competencies: DSA, Design Patterns, System Design, Soft Skills.

🕒 The Daily Battle Rhythm (3 Hours Minimum)

| Duration | Phase | Activity |
|---|---|---|
| 0-45 Mins | The Gym | DSA: Wake up the brain. Logic only. No frameworks. |
| 45-120 Mins | The Mission | Core Tech: Deep dive into Angular, Node, or Spring internals. |
| 120-150 Mins | The Briefing | Soft Skills: Reading system design blogs, learning jargon, practicing STAR stories. |

🗓️ Phase 1: Foundations & The Runtime (Week 1)
Goal: Understand the language before the tool. Fix the "Jargon" gap.

| Wed | DSA | Arrays & Strings (Two Pointer, Sliding Window). | Big O Notation, Space Complexity. |
| Thu | Patterns | Singleton & Factory. (Why use in DB connections?) | Loose Coupling, Separation of Concerns. |
| Fri | API Design | REST constraints. PUT vs PATCH. Status Codes. | Idempotency, Statelessness, Payload, URI. |
| Sat | Review | Mock Test: Explain Promise.all vs Promise.race. | Asynchronous, Non-blocking I/O. |

🚀 Phase 2: Frontend Superiority - Angular (Week 2)

|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | RxJS | Observables, Subjects, switchMap vs mergeMap. | Stream processing, Subscription, Memory Leaks. |
| Tue | Perf | Change Detection (Zone.js), OnPush Strategy. | Dirty Checking, DOM manipulation, Hydration. |
| Wed | Patterns | Smart vs Dumb Components (Container/Presenter). | Unidirectional Data Flow, Input/Output binding. |
| Thu | State | NgRx or Signals basics. Why state mgmt? | Single Source of Truth, Immutability, Reducer. |
| Fri | DSA | Hash Maps & Linked Lists (Implementation). | Collision resolution, Key-Value pair. |
| Sat | Build | Interceptors, Guards, Lazy Loading. | Bundle Size, Tree Shaking, Ahead-of-Time (AOT). |

⚙️ Phase 3: Backend Heavy Artillery - Spring & Node (Week 3)
Goal: Comparing the two giants. Knowing WHEN to use which.
| Day | Focus | Topic | 🧠 Jargon to Master |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | Spring | DI & IoC Container. Bean Scopes. | Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection. |
| Tue | Node | Express Middleware, Streams, Buffers. | Middleware Chain, Backpressure, Chunking. |
| Wed | Database | SQL Indexing, N+1 Problem (JPA/Hibernate). | Normalization, ACID Properties, Query Opt. |
| Thu | Patterns | Repository Pattern & DTOs. | Abstraction Layer, Data Transfer Object (DTO). |
| Fri | DSA | Trees (BST, Traversal) & Recursion. | DFS, BFS, Leaf Nodes, Root. |
| Sat | Security | JWT, OAuth2 flow, Spring Security Filters. | AuthN vs AuthZ, Stateless Auth, Salting. |

🏗️ Phase 4: System Design & "The Digressions" (Week 4)
Goal: This is where you pass the Senior interview. Connecting the boxes.
| Day | Focus | Topic | 🧠 Jargon to Master |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mon | Arch | Monolith vs Microservices. Pros/Cons. | Distributed Systems, Service Discovery, Latency. |
| Tue | Scaling | Load Balancing (Nginx) & Caching (Redis). | Vertical/Horizontal Scaling, Cache Eviction. |
| Wed | Async | Message Queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ). | Pub/Sub Model, Event-Driven, Decoupling. |
| Thu | Patterns | Circuit Breaker, API Gateway. | Fault Tolerance, Rate Limiting, Throttling. |
| Fri | DevOps | Docker basics. Container vs VM. | Containerization, Orchestration (K8s), CI/CD. |
| Sat | Synthesis | Design a "Twitter Clone" (High level). | CAP Theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition). |

🎖️ Phase 5 & 6: The Simulation (Interview Mode)
1. The DSA Grind
 * [ ] Solve 1 Medium LeetCode problem every single day.
 * [ ] Focus: Optimization (Time/Space).
2. Behavioral Stories (STAR Method)
Draft 5 stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for the following:
 * [ ] A conflict with a peer.
 * [ ] A time you optimized code/performance.
 * [ ] A time you missed a deadline.
 * [ ] A technical tradeoff you made.
 * [ ] A production bug you fixed.
3. The "Digression" Defense
 * Pick a random tech (GraphQL, WebSockets, gRPC).
 * Spend 15 mins learning WHAT it solves (not how to code it).
📜 Tactical Rules of Engagement
 * Don't Memorize Code: Memorize Constraints. (Why ArrayList? Fast read. Why Redis? DB is slow.)
 * Speak Out Loud: Explain concepts to an empty chair. If you stumble, you don't know it.
 * Google Correctly: Search "HashMap internal implementation," not "How to use Map."
 * Admit Ignorance Professionally: "I haven't used X, but based on Y, I assume..."
